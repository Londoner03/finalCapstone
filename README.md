INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGE REPAYMENT CALCULATOR

This is a program to help users calculate their investment returns on a given amount and given interest rate over a chosen term. It provides a calculator for both: 

1) investment returns and
2) mortgage repayment.

The importance of this project is to be able to use match calculations to help investors or borrowers to calculate and make informed decisions. It can be useful to answer questions like the following: 

1) how much difference would it make if I switch to a savings account with 1%pa higher interest rate?
2) how much more I would be expected to pay to repay my mortgage if I switch to 0.5%pa lower rate deal?
3) if I increase my monthly payments for the mortgage, how quickly can I repay my mortgage?
4) Shall I switch to a new mortgage deal or keep it as it is considering the likely costs involved to switch deals?

These are some of the frequently asked questions by clients. Offering them a calculator on your website may help you better interact with your clients and increase your sales.

Investors or borrowers do not need any special installation for this calculator as it can be put on your website to enable your clients to access it online
